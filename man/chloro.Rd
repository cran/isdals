\title{Chlorophyll concentration in winter wheat}
\description{
An experiment with winter wheat was carried in order to
investigate if the concentration of nitrogen in the soil can be
predicted from the concentration of chlorophyll in the plants.  
The chlorophyll concentration in the leaves as well as the nitrogen
concentration in the soil were measured for 18 plants.
